# Forkify
This application was built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

Forkify is a recipe app where you can search over 1,000,000 recipes, save ingredients to your shopping list and adjust serving sizes accordingly. You can 'like' recipes which will add them to your 'liked' list at the top right which you can access even after scrolling through other recipes or refreshing the page. Throughout this project, I learned how to setup a modern development workflow using Webpack and Babel including the use of localStorage.
